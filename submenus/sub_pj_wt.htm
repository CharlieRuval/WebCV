			As part of a comprehensive engineering project, I explored the current methods used for visual inspection of turbine generators, with a particular focus on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in restricted environments. This initial research helped me understand the capabilities and limitations of existing solutions and highlighted the importance of structured and autonomous inspection processes.<br>
			I modeled the complete inspection workflow, outlining the logical and physical steps involved during a UAV-based inspection. To describe the behavior of the UAV, I used finite state machines to represent different stages of the operation, including initialization, navigation, image capture, and return. This structure helped to define a clear and manageable sequence of actions.
			To improve system organization, I proposed a modeling approach that distinguishes between general planning levels and specific execution stages. This led to the development of a hierarchical model based on discrete event systems, where several layers of finite state machines operate with defined responsibilities. Each layer addressed a different level of abstraction, making the model easier to manage and adapt.<br>
			I also applied supervisory control techniques to manage the transitions between states and ensure that the system operated according to defined logic and safety conditions. The supervisor acted as a controller that enabled or restricted actions based on system status and predefined rules.<br>
			This project allowed me to gain experience applying theoretical tools to a practical engineering context. It helped me understand how structured modeling and control techniques can contribute to the design of safe and efficient inspection systems in industrial applications.
