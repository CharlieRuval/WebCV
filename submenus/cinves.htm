			During my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering, I developed a comprehensive understanding of both continuous and discrete control systems. I acquired the ability to model dynamic processes and design control strategies that drive these systems toward desired behaviors. This included the development and implementation of controllers for complex continuous systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles, electric motors, and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. In the discrete domain, I learned to model and control systems such as software application workflows and manufacturing processes, applying advanced control techniques to ensure optimal performance. I also explored the integration of control theory with computer vision, gaining experience in designing and training neural networks for decision-making and classification tasks. In particular, I applied these techniques to create intelligent control systems capable of adapting to varying conditions. Furthermore, I implemented supervisory control in hierarchical schemes within Android mobile applications, enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of the software. My academic training was grounded in rigorous mathematical coursework, including subjects such as abstract algebra, linear and nonlinear systems, stochastic processes, probability theory, and digital control, which provided the theoretical tools needed to address complex engineering challenges.<br>
