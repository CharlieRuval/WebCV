			Planned and drafted a hospital layout in AutoCAD, ensuring full compliance with NOM 001, 002, 007, 016, and 087 standards. The project required integrating architectural, structural, and regulatory considerations to create a safe, functional, and efficient healthcare environment. As part of the design, I carefully evaluated the distribution of lighting to guarantee sufficient illumination across all clinical and administrative areas, preventing visual fatigue and avoiding shadows in critical workspaces such as operating rooms and laboratories.

In addition, I incorporated strict safety protocols to prevent hazardous biological infectious waste (RPBI) from coming into contact with non-medical areas, thereby ensuring that waste management followed best practices for containment, handling, and disposal. The layout also accounted for the routing of medical gas pipelines, with specific attention to accessibility, redundancy, and emergency safety features, while aligning with established health and safety standards.

Electrical installations were strategically planned to support both normal and emergency operations, including the integration of backup systems and dedicated circuits for high-demand equipment. This comprehensive design process not only emphasized technical accuracy but also addressed practical hospital workflow needs, ensuring that medical staff could operate efficiently while maintaining patient safety and regulatory compliance.
