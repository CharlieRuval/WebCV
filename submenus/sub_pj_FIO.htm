			Developed a comprehensive virtual simulation environment in Factory I/O to model and evaluate a classifier system under realistic operating conditions. The project involved synchronizing Factory I/O with a specialized Petri net library in MATLAB, enabling the seamless integration of discrete-event modeling with real-time virtual processes. This synchronization ensured that the simulated environment accurately reflected the behavior of the Petri net models and supported advanced supervisory control techniques.

			<br>Within the simulation, I implemented the classification of packages by color, designing logic that allowed the system to detect, differentiate, and sort items according to predefined categories. This functionality mirrored industrial sorting processes and required combining virtual sensors in Factory I/O with event-driven dynamics governed by Petri nets.

			<br>To enhance reliability, I applied supervisory control methods specifically tailored to Petri nets, ensuring the system operated within safe states and avoided undesired behaviors such as deadlocks or resource conflicts. The control strategy optimized the workflow while guaranteeing compliance with system constraints.

			<br>This project showcased the successful integration of discrete-event control theory, MATLAB-based Petri net modeling, and the immersive virtual environment of Factory I/O. The result was a robust and scalable platform capable of testing industrial classification processes, validating control algorithms, and providing a foundation for future implementation in real-world automated systems.
