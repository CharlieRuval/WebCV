			Part time professor

		<div class="texto">
			As part-time professor, I designed and taught courses such as Kinematics of Mechanisms, Hydraulic and Pneumatic Automation, and Mechatronics Projects, with an emphasis on modeling and simulation techniques. I developed engaging presentations that connected theoretical concepts with real-world applications, helping students connect academic knowledge with practical implementation. To enhance understanding, I created simulations of engineering systems in virtual environments, allowing students to visualize and understand abstract concepts more effectively. I also contributed to the development of laboratory equipment, including the design and construction of PLC training bases and pneumatic training systems, enriching the hands-on learning experience.<br>
			I continually sought out the most effective tools to communicate engineering concepts clearly, using institutional software such as SolidWorks, MATLAB, and Simulink, along with free tools such as Kinovea and Linkage. These platforms helped students engage with theoretical content in an interactive and accessible way.<br>
			Above all, I have always been committed to supporting my students' success, not only in the subjects I teach, but throughout their broader academic journeys. I make myself available to help them whenever they need guidance, encouragement, or technical assistance, creating an environment where they feel safe to ask questions, explore ideas, and grow professionally.

			Data analyst
		</h2>

		<div class="texto">
			In my role as a data analyst, I was involved in end-to-end data processing tasks, with a primary focus on extracting relevant features from structured and unstructured web data using web scraping techniques. I developed and maintained custom Python functions to automate and streamline the extraction process, improving both efficiency and reliability. I worked extensively with PySpark to manipulate large datasets, applying distributed computing techniques to accelerate processing and optimize resource usage.<br>
			One of my key contributions was assisting in the migration of data processing libraries from Databricks to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This involved adapting code to work with new environments, ensuring compatibility with cloud-based tools, and validating that processing outputs remained consistent across platforms. I collaborated with cross-functional teams—including data scientists, engineers, and business analysts—to organize, clean, and standardize datasets, enhancing their usability for analytics and decision-making.<br>
			Version control played an essential role in our development workflow, and I leveraged GitHub to manage code versions, document changes, and support collaborative, iterative improvement. I also contributed to technical documentation for the processing functions and workflows, supporting maintainability and easing future onboarding.<br>
			Throughout my experience, I have demonstrated strong self-learning skills, often acquiring new tools, libraries, and techniques independently to meet project demands and expand my capabilities. My ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies has been key in delivering effective and timely solutions in dynamic environments.
